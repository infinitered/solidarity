### WHY DOES SOLIDARITY EXIST:question:
I know the one-liner under the graphic isn't for everyone.  If you'd like a quick, friendly explanation, please take two minutes to read [the announcement blog post](https://shift.infinite.red/solidarity-the-cli-for-developer-sanity-672fa81b98e9).

## Install
Install the command globally OR use via `node_modules`.  It's suggested you install your snapshot plugins in the same place.

Note:
Node.js version must be >= `7.6.0`.
```sh
# example of installing global with npm and react-native snapshot
$ npm i -g solidarity solidarity-react-native

# example of installing local with yarn and elixir snapshot (dev dependencies)
$ yarn add solidarity solidarity-elixir --dev
```

## How do I use it?
Using solidarity is easy! Run the following command to check the current project environment.
```sh
$ solidarity
```
This command looks for the `.solidarity` file in the working directory, and then runs a check of the containing rules against your environment.  The command exit code is tied to the success of the solidarity check for testing frameworks.

## How do I update it to my machine specs?
Environment updates can be stored to solidarity quickly.
```sh
$ solidarity snapshot
```
The `snapshot` parameter will update the rules in the `.solidarity` file to the current system specs. By default a snapshot will be strict with the versions of _everything_ detected.  But, semantic versioning is supported.

## How do I create my first snapshot?
If no `.solidarity` file is present, then `solidarity snapshot` prompts you to identify the technology your project depends on.

```sh
$ solidarity snapshot
No `.solidarity` file found for this project.  Would you like to create one? (Y/n)
```

Custom rule-sets can be created by modifying the `.solidarity` file by hand, or by creating a solidarity plugin for a given technology.  [See documentation](https://infinitered.github.io/solidarity/) for how you can create your own.

## Cross Platform
Solidarity works with Mac/Linux/Windows environments. CI tests all rules with each platform on every update.
